## Building the Transformer Model with PyTorch
To build the Transformer model, the following steps are necessary:

    Importing the libraries and modules.
    Defining the basic building blocks: Multi-head Attention, Position-Wise Feed-Forward Networks, Positional Encoding.
    Building the Encoder block.
    Building the Decoder block.
    Combining the Encoder and Decoder layers to create the complete Transformer network.
